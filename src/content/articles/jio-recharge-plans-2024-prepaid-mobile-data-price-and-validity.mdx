Jio came with a revolution in India in the year 2016. From its inception, it never looked back. Now it has become the leading telecommunication company in India. It has constantly increased its subscribers. Till October 2024, Jio has 481.8 million subscribers which is more than 33% of India’s total population. That is huge! Right?

Since Jio came into the telecommunication field, it has provided the customer with its free plans. I still remember I had to stand in the queue for almost six hours to get a Jio SIM card. Now the dynamics have changed and the companies including Jio have begun to charge for their services. Jio with Airtel and Vi have also increased their prices with the advent of their 5G services. Below we are going to discuss their prepaid recharge plans for mobile. I will write only the relevant plans that I think will be beneficial to you rather than all plans.

## Truly 5G Unlimited Plans:

Jio only provides unlimited 5G data only on or above its 2 GB/Day plans. Here 2 GB data is exhaustible if you are on 4G usage. If you surf the internet on a 5G network it will not reduce your 2GB quota per day as surfing on 5G is unlimited. Below is the plan, validity, and data threshold in tabular form.

| Price  | Validity (Days) | Data             |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| ₹ 198  | 14              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 349  | 28              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 629  | 56              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 719  | 70              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 749  | 72              | 2 GB/Day + 20 GB |
| ₹ 859  | 84              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 899  | 90              | 2 GB/Day + 20 GB |
| ₹ 999  | 98              | 2 GB/Day         |
| ₹ 3599 | 365             | 2.5 GB/Day       |
